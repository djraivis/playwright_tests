- End-to-end testing is a software testing methodology used to validate that a system or application is working correctly from beginning to end, simulating a real-world user experience.

- In end-to-end testing, the software is tested from the user's point of view, ensuring that all components of the system interact with each other as expected, and the system works as a whole. This testing approach involves testing the entire system or application, including all its components, databases, servers, and interfaces, to ensure that they work together seamlessly.

- End-to-end testing is typically performed after other types of testing, such as unit and integration testing, have been completed. The goal of end-to-end testing is to verify that the system is working as intended and to catch any issues that might not have been discovered in previous testing phases.

- End-to-end testing is critical for ensuring the quality of complex software systems, especially those that involve multiple components, integrations, and interfaces. This approach helps to identify issues that may only occur when all the components are working together, and it helps to ensure that the user experience is seamless and bug-free.
